h1. preGrbl - A g-code preprocessor for grbl, the 3-axis CNC Arduino firmware.

PreGrbl intends to offload higher level tasks and computationally expensive routines from the on-board firmware of Grbl, primarily to keep Grbl simple and efficient. These tasks include more robust and complete NIST g-code error checking, implementing canned cycles by translating the tool paths, and converting the g-code into a Grbl-friendly format. 

In the near future, PreGrbl may be used as a starting point for a full-featured CNC user interface for Grbl, much like EMC2 or Mach3. For example, a GUI interface would translate a g-code program with canned cycles into a Grbl-friendly format and stream it in the background directly to Grbl. 

Current Features:
  - Notifies unsupported g-code commands for grbl
  - Converts G02/03 arcs to G01 linear interpolations
  - Removes comments, block delete characters, and line numbers
  - Removes spaces and capitalizes commands
  - Minor input error checking
  - OPTIONAL: Remove unsupported grbl G and M commands

To Do: 
  - Add canned cycle translation
  - Number precision identification and truncation
  - Arc conversion option
  - More robust and complete error checking
  - Command line interface options
  - Improve g-code parsing to NIST standards
  - Support inverse feed rates
