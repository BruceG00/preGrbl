h1. preGrbl - Fork of preGrbl, A g-code preprocessor for grbl, the 3-axis CNC Arduino firmware.

PreGrbl intends to offload higher level tasks and computationally expensive routines from the on-board firmware of Grbl, primarily to keep Grbl simple and efficient. These tasks include more robust and complete NIST g-code error checking, implementing canned cycles by translating the tool paths, and converting the g-code into a Grbl-friendly format. 

Current Features:
  - Notifies unsupported g-code commands for grbl
  - Converts G02/03 arcs to G01 linear interpolations
  - Removes comments, block delete characters, and line numbers
  - Removes spaces and capitalizes commands
  - Minor input error checking
  - OPTIONAL: Remove unsupported grbl G and M commands

To Do: 
  - Update to Grbl 0.8c
  - Add option to include user generated post gcode commands
  - Check for metric vs imperial units - add G20 if using UGS

Stretch To Do:
  - Add canned cycle translation
  - Number precision identification and truncation
  - Arc conversion option
  - More robust and complete error checking
  - Command line interface options
  - Improve g-code parsing to NIST standards
  - Support inverse feed rates
